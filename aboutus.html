  <p> Hi! I am Kamilla and I was motivated to make this project during my summer immersion program at girls who code since I am a public school student that observes the unfair system from the inside. Education plays an important role in the quality of life and overall well-being of society. Children are the future of society, they are the ones who will run the country and world in the coming times. It is important that we provide our children with an equal chance to receive the quality education they deserve. However, due to lack of resources and unfair distribution of funding, many students have not been able to receive the desired education and achieve their goals.<p>
