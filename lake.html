  <p> Lake Baikal, the oldest and deepest freshwater lake in the world, contains one-fifth of the planet's liquid freshwater. Despite being less than one-tenth the size of Russia's Caspian Sea, Baikal's remarkable depth, which reaches over a mile in some areas, allows it to hold more water. If all the rivers on Earth were redirected to drain into Baikal simultaneously, it would take over a year to empty, and the water would supply the entire global population with drinking water for fifty years. Situated on a continental rift zone, the lake is gradually becoming deeper as the Earth's crust slowly pulls apart. Renowned for its pristine clarity, Baikal's waters, fed by melted ice from the surrounding Siberian mountains, allow visibility down to 130 feet during the summer. The lake is home to over 2,000 unique species, including the scaleless golomyanka fish and the nerpa seal, which exist nowhere else on the planet. This extraordinary biodiversity inspired James Cameron's underwater settings in Avatar 2.<p>
